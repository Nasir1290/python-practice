# variable naming conventions:
# name should only contain letters , numbers and underscores. it cant contain some special characters like @,%,$,! etc.
# name should start with a letter or underscore but the convation is to start it with a letter.

# name="nasir"


# boolean values
# boolean values can be either True or False.and their first character is uppercase like True or False.
# a = True
# b=False
# print(a)
# print(b)


# to know any values type we have to use type() function..
# a = "name"
# print(type(a))


# reserved keywords...
# python has some reserved keywords like "and", "or", "not","if", "else","elif","def","del","raise","return","True","false". and we can't use them as our variables name.
# like we can't do this ðŸ‘‰ True = True because True is a reserved word in python.


# import math
# print(math.floor(5.2))

# age =float(input("Enter yur age: "))
# print("age is :", age)
