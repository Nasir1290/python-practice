# Loops in python ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

# Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python supports two types of loops: (1)for loops and (2)while loops


# for loopsðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

# # iterating ovet a list 
# fruits = ["apple", "orange", "blackberry","mango","banana","cupcake","cherry"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruits.index(fruit)+1,":",fruit)


# # iterating overa  range of numbers
# for num in range(1,6):
#     print(num)



# # iterating over a dictionary
# student_score = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 92, "Charlie": 78}
# for student,score in student_score.items():
#     print(student,"got:",score)



# # using a else after a for loop if you want to execute a block of code after your for loop completion
# for i in range (1,6):
#     print(i)
# else:
#     print("execute your own code you want to execute")





# while loops are run depending on a condition
